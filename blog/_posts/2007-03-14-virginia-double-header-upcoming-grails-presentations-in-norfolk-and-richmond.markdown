If you&#39;ll be in Hampton Roads on Tuesday of next week or in the Richmond area on Wednesday, I&#39;ll be presenting a couple sessions on [Grails](http://grails.org) that I happily invite you come check out.  It&#39;s a [promising time for Grails](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2007/03/12/grails-is-on-the-move/), and I think you&#39;ll find this talk to be a nice kick start towards bringing you up to speed on one of the Java platform&#39;s most exciting up-and-coming technologies.  Come learn how this hyper-productive next-generation framework can transform web development as you know it.    The [Southeast Virginia Java Users Group (SEVAJUG)](http://www.sevajug.org/) is hosting the first presentation at 7 PM on March 20th in Norfolk, VA.  And on the following night (March 21st), the [Richmond Java User Group (RJUG)](http://www.richmondjug.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/) is hosting the presentation at 5:30 PM.    If you&#39;re in the area, I hope to see you there.
