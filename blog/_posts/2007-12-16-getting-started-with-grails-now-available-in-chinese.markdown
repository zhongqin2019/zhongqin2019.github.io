The [Chinese version](http://www.infoq.com/cn/minibooks/grails "Getting Started with Grails - Chinese Translation") of [*Getting Started with Grails*](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Grails-Jason-Rudolph/dp/143030782X) made its debut last week.

In fact, InfoQ has been steadily growing their [Chinese Grails portal](http://www.infoq.com/cn/grails "InfoQ Chinese Grails Portal") for quite a while now.  There you'll find updates on the recent Groovy and Grails support in IntelliJ IDEA 7, Guillaume Laforge waxing philosophical on Groovy DSLs, a ([familiar](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2006/08/22/grails-ejb3-article-on-infoq/ "Grails + EJB3 Article on InfoQ")) article on using [Grails+EJB3](http://www.infoq.com/cn/news/2007/08/grails-ejb-tutorial "InfoQ: Grails + EJB Domain Models Step-by-Step - Chinese Translation"), and more.

Add these resources to the [Japanese](http://www.grails.org/Japanese+Home "grails.org - Japanese Translation") and [Korean](http://www.grails.org/Korean+Home "grails.org - Korean Translation") docs on grails.org, [Sven's upcoming German book on Grails](http://www.flavor.de/snipsnap/space/start/2007-09-22/1 "Sven Haiges"), and undoubtedly several other international resources in the works, and we're rapidly starting to see a whole new meaning to good [i18n support](http://grails.org/doc/1.0.x/guide/single.html#10.%20Internationalization "The Grails Framework - Reference Documentation - Internationalization").
