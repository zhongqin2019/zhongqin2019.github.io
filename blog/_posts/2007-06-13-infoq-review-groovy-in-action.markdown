<p>InfoQ has just published my <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/groovy-action" title="Groovy in Action review by Jason Rudolph (InfoQ)">review</a>   of the must-read book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGroovy-Action-Dierk-Koenig%2Fdp%2F1932394842%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1165386946%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=abougroo-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Groovy in Action</a></em>.&nbsp; If you&#39;re doing anything with <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" title="Groovy">Groovy</a>, or even considering it, you really owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this book.&nbsp; If you haven&#39;t had a chance yet to check out <em>Groovy in Action</em>, the review should give you a good idea of what to expect from the book, and <a href="http://www.manning.com/koenig/">Manning</a>  has also thrown in two chapter excerpts from the book (including one on the incredibly handy <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/groovy-jdk.html">Groovy JDK</a>) to give you a feel for it first-hand.</p> <p>If you notice that the review reads a bit differently than what you might typically expect, that&#39;s due to InfoQ&#39;s unique requirements for its reviews.&nbsp; InfoQ reviews aim to &quot;contain less <em>metadata</em> and more <em>data</em>, or said differently, less talk <em>about</em> the book and more talk <em>of</em> the content in the book.&quot;&nbsp; The hope is that the reader learns something even while reading the review.&nbsp; It seems like a cool idea to me.&nbsp; So, what do you think?&nbsp; Let us know in the comments over on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/groovy-action" title="Groovy in Action review by Jason Rudolph (InfoQ)">InfoQ</a>   or below.</p>
