<p>Sven Haiges has convinced his employer to give Grails  a shot, and he&#39;s decided to chronicle his journey in a weekly <a href="http://www.flavor.de/snipsnap/space/Grails+Podcast">Grails podcast</a>.&nbsp; He gives an honest play-by-play of his successes, the occasional bumps along the way, and the workarounds as well.&nbsp; He&#39;s hit the ground running, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://hansamann.podspot.de/files/grails_podcast_episode_2.mp3">second episode</a>  discusses <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2006/06/20/hoisting-grails-to-your-legacy-db/">connecting Grails to a legacy database schema</a>, his interview with Groovy project lead Guillaume Laforge, and Eclipse support for Groovy and Grails.&nbsp; It&#39;ll no doubt be interesting to witness the real-world adoption of this promising framework.&nbsp; Kudos to Sven for sharing his experience and for choosing podcasting as the way to do so.</p>
