The [Testing Anti-patterns series](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/testing-anti-patterns-how-to-fail-with-100-test-coverage/ "jasonrudolph.com/blog - Testing Anti-patterns: How to Fail With 100% Test Coverage") began as a conference presentation titled **How to Fail With 100% Test Coverage**, and I recently had the pleasure of presenting that talk at the [Raleigh-Area Ruby Brigade (raleigh.rb)](http://ruby.meetup.com/3/calendar/7849526/ "Raleigh-area Ruby Brigade August Meeting - Jason Rudolph on 'How to Fail With 100% Test Coverage'").  [Matthew Bass](http://matthewbass.com "matthewbass.com") was kind enough to record the audio from the event, and I've taken a stab at syncing that audio with the slides for a full-on multimedia extravaganza.<sup>&sect;</sup>

<sup>&sect;</sup> Keynote's Quicktime recording/exporting has a seemingly diabolical sense of humor.  For comedic effect (or perhaps to make sure you're paying attention), it likes to randomly shuffle the slides every once in a while.  So in the video, you'll notice that unfortunately the slides and the audio don't *always* line up just right.  If you find it too erratic, then it may be easier to listen to the [audio](http://www.raleighrb.com/podcast/2008-08-19_how_to_fail.mp3 "raleigh.rb MP3 - Jason Rudolph on 'How to Fail With 100% Test Coverage'") and advance the [slides](http://jasonrudolph.com/downloads/presentations/How_to_Fail_With_100_Percent_Test_Coverage.pdf "Slides - Jason Rudolph on 'How to Fail With 100% Test Coverage'"") manually.  And if you see Tyler Durden make a cameo, well, it was probably just Keynote having a laugh.
