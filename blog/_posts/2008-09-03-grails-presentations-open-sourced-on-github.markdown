Want to help convince your peers to take Grails for a spin?  Are you looking to give a presentation to your dev team, your company, or perhaps a local user group?  If you'd rather not have to assemble a presentation from scratch, I've got good news for you: you can now grab the raw Keynote files and demo code for my [Grails presentations on GitHub](http://github.com/jasonrudolph/ "jasonrudolph's Profile &mdash; GitHub").  (If you don't have Keynote, no worries: the PDFs are available as well).  And it's GitHub, so feel free to fork, customize, and spread the good word.  Remember: As long as there's an IDE somewhere with an open struts-config file, there's a developer in need of help.

If you're not using Git yet, well, you should be.  Seriously.  But that's a [different post altogether](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2008/04/22/git-init-say-hello-to-agility/ "jasonrudolph/blog - git init: Say Hello to Agility").  In the meantime though, you can download any of the presentations as a zip file or tarball.  Just look for the "download" button on the GitHub page for each presentation.

Enjoy!
