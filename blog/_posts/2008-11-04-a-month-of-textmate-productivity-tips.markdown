I've had the joy of calling [TextMate](http://macromates.com/ "TextMate â€” The Missing Editor for Mac OS X") my editor of choice for almost three years now, and as the [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips "Pragmatic Software Development Tips from the "Pragmatic Programmer"") wisely recommends, my editor has definitely grown to become "an extension of [my] hand."  Often when giving a presentation or pair programming, someone will stop me to ask, "Wait a minute. How'd you do that?" "*That*" is inevitably in reference to some bit of hyper-productive TextMate keyboard wizardry that eliminated several steps the person was otherwise expecting to see. Of course, a few years ago you were more likely to hear *me* asking that question. (And I still love it when I get to ask that question nowadays.)

For the month of November, I'll share one of these *"How'd you do that?"* tips each day. They're by no means revolutionary; they're much more in the *oldie but goodie* camp.  Hence the name: **TextMate Oldie But Goodie Of The Day (TMOBGOTD)**. Each one can shave time - sometimes several seconds - off of common tasks.  And if they're common tasks in your workflow, then that time surely adds up.  

You can follow along at [twitter.com/jasonrudolph](http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph "Twitter / Jason Rudolph"), where the first four tips are already in place.

1. [November 1](http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph/status/985128152 "Twitter / jasonrudolph: TMOBGOTD #1: TextMate Oldie But Goodie Of The Day") - Use **Control+Option+Command+V** to view your clipboard history. Then hit **Enter** to paste the selected item into the current document.
2. [November 2](http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph/status/986324036 "Twitter / jasonrudolph: TMOBGOTD #2: TextMate Oldie But Goodie Of The Day") - Use **Control+Shift+C** to access the Math bundle from any file. Instantly perform calculations, add/subtract selected numbers, and more.
3. [November 3](http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph/status/987583480 "Twitter / jasonrudolph: TMOBGOTD #3: TextMate Oldie But Goodie Of The Day") - With your cursor on any Ruby string, use **Control+Shift+`'`** to toggle between single quotes, double quotes, and `%Q{}`. Also works with Groovy, JavaScript, Perl, SQL, Bash, etc.
4. [November 4](http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph/status/989258974 "Twitter / jasonrudolph: TMOBGOTD #4: TextMate Oldie But Goodie Of The Day") - In HTML (or HTML-friendly) files, select several lines and use **Control+Command+Shift+W** to wrap each line in a pair of HTML tags.

Whether you're seeing these techniques for the first time or rediscovering a command that you'd forgotten about, take a moment to try it out.  Perform each technique three times, and you'll be well on your way to committing it to memory. In just 60 seconds a day, you too can train to become a TextMate black belt.  Or double your money back.  Guaranteed.
