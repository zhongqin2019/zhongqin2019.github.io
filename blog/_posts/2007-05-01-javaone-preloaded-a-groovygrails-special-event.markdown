If you're heading to JavaOne next week, what better way to get the festivities started than to spend an evening checking out the one-two punch that is [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and [Grails](http://grails.org/)?!  The No Fluff Just Stuff Java Symposium Series is hosting the [Groovy/Grails One Meet-up](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/groovygrailsmeetup/) from 6:30 - 10:30 on Monday night at the W Hotel, just across the street from the Moscone Center.  

Come on out and hear the latest news on the [just-released Groovy 1.1 beta](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2007/04/30/groovy-11-beta-1-released-takes-java-integration-to-the-next-level/). Groovy Project Lead, Guillaume LaForge, will be on hand with all the details.  And, you won't want to miss Graeme Rocher, Grails Project Lead, as he brings you up to speed on the slam-packed Grails 0.5 release due out any moment.  We'll follow up those presentations with giveaways, demos, and a panel discussion including
Dierk Koenig, lead author of [Groovy in Action](http://www.manning.com/koenig/); Andrew Glover, co-author of [Groovy in Action](http://www.manning.com/koenig/); Neal Ford, DSL Guru; and yours truly.

And in a genuine show of class, the NFJS folks have added a charitable angle to the event.  Registration is free, but they've asked that attendees make a small donation to the charity of their choice.  In exchange, you get to check out two of the most promising technologies in the Java world today, meet some of the people behind the scenes, and you even stand a chance to win some cool gear.  Well done!

Attendance is limited, so [register early](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/groovygrailsmeetup)!
