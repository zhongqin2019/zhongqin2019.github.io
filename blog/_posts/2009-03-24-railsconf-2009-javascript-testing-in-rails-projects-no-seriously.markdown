Going to RailsConf in Las Vegas this year?  [Larry Karnowski](http://tech.hickorywind.org/ "HickoryTech") and I are presenting a session on [giving your JavaScript code the testing love it deserves](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/8013 "JavaScript Testing in Rails: Fast, Headless, In-Browser. Pick Any Three").

Our talk is on Tuesday, May 5 at 1:50 PM in Ballroom B.  

> **JavaScript testing in Rails: Fast, headless, in-browser. Pick any three.**<br/><br/>
> You wouldn’t consider developing a Rails application without having a solid test suite for your Ruby code, but you’ve somehow convinced yourself to cross your fingers and look the other way when it comes to JavaScript. It doesn’t have to be that way. In this session, you’ll learn how to apply test-driven and behavior-driven development to your unobtrusive JavaScript code in a Rails-friendly manner.

Hope to see you there!
