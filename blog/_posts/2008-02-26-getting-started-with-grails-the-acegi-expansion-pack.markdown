InfoQ recently published a [step-by-step tutorial](http://www.infoq.com/articles/grails-acegi-integration "InfoQ: Securing a Grails Application with Acegi Security") for quickly installing and configuring the Grails Acegi plugin into the Racetrack application (originally developed in [Getting Started with Grails](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2007/01/17/just-released-getting-started-with-grails/ "jasonrudolph.com - Blog - Just Released: Getting Started with Grails")).  Kudos to Fadi Shami for assembling this handy guide.
