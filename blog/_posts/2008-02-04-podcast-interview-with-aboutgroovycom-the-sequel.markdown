[It's been almost a year](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2007/02/14/podcast-interview-with-aboutgroovycom/ "Podcast Interview with aboutGroovy.com") since I first sat down with Scott Davis for an [aboutGroovy.com interview](http://aboutgroovy.com/podcast/show/6 "2GX Speaker Jason Rudolph"), and the [upcoming Groovy/Grails Experience](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2007/12/20/2gx-next-gen-java-conference-is-right-around-the-corner/ "2GX - Next-Gen Java Conference Is Right Around the Corner") seemed as good a reason as any for us to catch up.

In addition to discussing the various [conference sessions](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/speaker?speakerId=4738&amp;showId=131) in the works, we also spend a few moments exploring some relative merits of Rails and Grails.  While we won't tell you [which framework is right for you](http://relevancellc.com/2008/1/11/how-to-pick-a-platform "Relevance, Inc. - How to Pick a Platform"), I do suggest some key features that each framework could stand to adopt from the other, and we even discuss how [some of that cross-pollination is already coming to fruition](http://opensource.thinkrelevance.com/wiki/simple_services "Relevance Open Source - simple_services").

Many thanks to Scott for having me on the podcast.
