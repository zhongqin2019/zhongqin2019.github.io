* [More evidence](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/03/tott-understanding-your-coverage-data.html "Google Testing Blog: TotT: Understanding Your Coverage Data") that 100% test coverage is just a good place to *start*.

* And here I thought perhaps it was finally time to drop [BASIC](http://prog21.dadgum.com/21.html "Slumming with BASIC Programmers") from my resume. <sup>&sect;</sup>  

* [Dave Klein takes on a gnarly Oracle schema using the Grails ORM DSL](http://dave-klein.blogspot.com/2008/03/grails-orm-dsl-rules.html "Grails' ORM DSL Rules!").  If you're dying to see some XML or annotations in use, then well, you need help, and this tutorial simply ain't for you.

* Git repo containing the complete Rails source code *and* it's entire revision history: 21.9 MB.  SVN checkout of the *current* Rails source code with *no* history: 23.8 MB.  [Convinced yet?](http://www.sanityinc.com/articles/rails-on-git "Rails on Git: How much hype fits in 9MB? â€” Sanity, Inc.") <sup>&Dagger;</sup>

* [Safari 3.1 hits the street](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307467 "About the Safari 3.1 Update"), now with  <del>more cowbell</del> marginally better dev tools.  Oh well, it's still feels like the best fit for day-to-day browsing, but it's got a long way to go if it's ever gonna compete with Firebug for some real web developer love.
