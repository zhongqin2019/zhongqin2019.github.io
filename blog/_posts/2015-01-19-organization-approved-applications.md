I'm excited to share the latest feature that [@pengwynn](https://github.com/pengwynn), [@jonrohan](https://github.com/jonrohan), & I have been working on for the GitHub platform.

Applications integrate with GitHub to help you and your team build, test, and deploy software. But not all apps are created equal. By adopting a list of approved applications, organization admins can better manage which apps can be given access to their organization's data.
