[Grails 0.5](http://grails.org/download) is out, and it's busting at the seams with improvements! This release marks a huge milestone in the [march towards Grails 1.0](http://grails.org/roadmap), as it brings with it a whole host of features that truly take Grails to the next level.  The real heavy hitters include a DSL for custom URL mappings, command objects, and GORM's continued quest to free the world from the evils of painful Object Relational Mapping.  You'll also find this release sporting the [new Groovy 1.1 beta distro](http://site.com/), an improved developer experience (thanks to major improvements in hot reloading of key artifacts), an almost 50% increase in performance, and resolutions for over 200 JIRA issues.  Be sure to check out the [release notes](http://grails.org/0.5+Release+Notes) for details on (and examples of) these and many other features of this slam-packed release.
