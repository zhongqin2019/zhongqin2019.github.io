Marcos FÃ¡bio Pereira has just published a [step-by-step guide](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRAILS/Jasper+Plugin "JasperGrails tutorial") for using the slick JasperGrails plugin in the Racetrack application (originally developed in [Getting Started with Grails](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2007/01/17/just-released-getting-started-with-grails/ "jasonrudolph.com - Blog - Just Released: Getting Started with Grails")).  The tutorial includes examples of generating a PDF of all the races in the app, exporting an Excel spreadsheet listing all the registrations for a race, and the impressively concise bits of code necessary to get this new tastiness up and running.

Nicely done, Marcos!
