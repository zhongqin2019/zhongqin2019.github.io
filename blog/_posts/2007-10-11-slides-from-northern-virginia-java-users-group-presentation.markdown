As part of a promo for the upcoming [Northern Virginia Software Symposium](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/reston/2007/11/index.html "Northern Virginia Software Symposium - November 02 - 04, 2007"), I had the privilege last night of introducing Grails to an enthusiastic crowd at the [NovaJUG](http://www.jroller.com/novajugblog/entry/oct_10th_getting_started_with).  With the consistent scene of nodding heads and inquiries of, "Can I still use Grails in situation X?", it's increasingly clear just how very many pain points [Grails](http://grails.org) addresses for Java web developers.  

The slides from my presentation are now available at...

...but there's just no substitute for the excellent discourse we enjoyed thanks to the insightful questions of a truly engaged group of developers.  

Thanks, NovaJUG!
