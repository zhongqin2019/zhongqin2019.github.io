[Streamlined 0.9](http://www.streamlinedframework.org/pages/0_9_release_notes "Streamlined 0.9 Release Notes") is now available for download.  From the rich and handy [quick-add](http://trac.streamlinedframework.org/wiki/QuickAdd) interface to the super-flexible and highly-interactive [advanced filtering](http://trac.streamlinedframework.org/wiki/AdvancedFiltering), this release packs a big punch in terms of quickly empowering your end users with a serious data management interface.  In addition to introducing the aforementioned heavy hitters, it also makes standard many common idioms to increase the overall usability of your apps (e.g., auto-labeling for required fields) and offers some optional usability enhancers (mmmm, tasty breadcrumbs) as well.

Of course, those are just *some* of the many improvements available in Streamlined 0.9.  Be sure to check out the [release notes](http://www.streamlinedframework.org/pages/0_9_release_notes "Streamlined 0.9 Release Notes") for full details, including screen shots and links to additional docs.

As we approach 1.0, Streamlined continues to position itself as *the* solution for developing an instant, production-ready UI for your ActiveRecord models.  So, what are you waiting for?  Stop banging rocks together and [build something!](http://streamlinedframework.org "Streamlined")
