In the spirit of Andy Glover's [Weekly Bag](http://thediscoblog.com/2008/03/08/the-weekly-bag-march-7/ "The Disco Blog - The weekly bag - March 7") and Bill Dupre's frequent batches of [Whatever](http://wpdupre.blogspot.com/2008/03/whatever.html "whatever"), herein lies the first installment in a (sure-to-be-sporadic) series of [Noteworthy Nonsense](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/tag/nonsense/ "jasonrudolph.com - Blog Category - Noteworthy Nonsense").  

* iPhone web app authors rejoice!  (Yes. You read that right.  *Web*-app authors.)  Test your web apps using the *official* [iPhone simulator](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/ "Apple Developer Connection - iPhone Dev Center - iPhone Developer Program").  (And, oh yeah, you can [go native](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/details.html "Apple Developer Connection - iPhone Dev Center - iPhone Developer Program Details") now too...but the lack of RubyCocoa support is a bit of a downer.)

* A [plugin](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRAILS/Struts+1+Plugin "Grails Struts 1.X Plugin") that lets you run Struts 1.x code inside a Grails app?  Yeah, I cringed too, but this will surely be a welcome migration path for those folks trapped in the land of <code>*.do</code>.  

* Are SVN users suffering from the Blub paradox?  Linus pulls no punches in offering up [his take on this matter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 "YouTube - Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git").  

* Dan Benjamin's back with the [Leopard edition](http://hivelogic.com/articles/ruby-rails-leopard/ "Hivelogic: Installing Ruby, Rubygems, Rails, and Mongrel on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)") of his definitive "how-to" guide for rolling your own installation of Ruby, Rails, and friends.  

* The [last time Glen Smith declared a month o' Grails](http://blogs.bytecode.com.au:80/glen/2007/02/27/grails-challenge--pens-down.html "Glen Smith - Grails Challenge: Pens Down"), he showed the community just how very much is possible with merely an hour a day.  Now Glen's at it again, but this time it's [MockFor(March)](http://blogs.bytecode.com.au/glen/2008/03/04/mockfor-march---overcoming-grails-testing-inertia.html "Glen Smith - MockFor(March): Overcoming Grails testing inertia").  If history is any indicator, expect Glen to blaze new trails in the land of Grails unit testing.  Glen: [It takes GUTs](http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/The_modern_programming_professional_has_GUTs "Alistair Cockburn - The modern programming professional has GUTs"), but I'm rootin' for you!

* Speaking of good unit tests, [Jay Fields announced a new version of the expectations gem](http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/03/ruby-expectations-gem-version-023.html "Jay Fields Thoughts: Ruby: expectations gem version 0.2.3"), complete with a healthy dose of example code.  One expectation per test?  Saying "goodbye" to cumbersome test names?  Jay's onto something here.
