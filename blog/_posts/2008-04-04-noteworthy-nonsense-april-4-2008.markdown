* Geertjan Wielenga suggests the [first (and only) Java closure solution that makes any sense](http://groovy.dzone.com/news/closures-solution-include-groo "Closures Solution: Include Groovy in the JDK? — Groovy Zone").

* [Wait for it. Wait for it. Are you serious?! Damn, that's cool!](http://www.evernote.com/video/ "Evernote - Overview Video")

* As always, Alan Hoffler offers some welcome advice "and stuff like that" on [using words that add nothing to your message](http://www.millswyck.com/blog/index.php/2008/03/16/talk-for-uh-twenty-seconds/ "Your message and other things you say - Talk for, uh, twenty seconds?").

* [Rails goes Git](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/4/2/rails-is-moving-from-svn-to-git "Riding Rails: Rails is moving from SVN to Git").  Sweet!  Who's next?

* Multi-touch is so [1984](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/230 "TED Talks — Nicholas Negroponte demonstrating touch screen technology at the inaugural TED conference in 1984").

* ["Working for oneself, or at least for a small group, is the natural way for programmers to live."](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html "You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss") Well said.  And if you disagree with Paul Graham, watch out; [you're being graded](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html "How to Disagree").
