The Triangle's local Agile group is hosting a round of [lightning talks tonight](http://agile.meetup.com/29/calendar/7277944/ "Agile RTP - Lightning Talks").  I'll be pitching a quick demo showing just how much [Mingle](http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence) rocks, but it's an open floor, so everything's fair game.  

From the meeting description...

<blockquote>
We'll be doing a lightning talk night with a rejectconf twist. What that means is that there's no hard time limit, but talks will get sorted by estimated talk time, shortest to longest. The shorter your talk, the more talks we can see and the more likelihood you'll get to give it. So start thinking about something quick and cool you could share with us - it'll be a blast!
</blockquote>

The meetup gets underway at 6:30 PM.  ([See the Agile RTP site for full details.](http://agile.meetup.com/29/calendar/7277944/ "Lightning Talks -  Agile RTP (ARTp) (Raleigh, NC) - Meetup.com"))  If you're nearby, come on out.  Hope to see you there!
