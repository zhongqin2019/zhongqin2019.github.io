Want to know more about just how easy it is to contribute to the many open source projects that you use day in and day out?  The [Refactotum](http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/twir "Relevance, Inc. - Refactotum") series is dedicated to showing you how.  Coming up at [RailsConf](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/2101 "RailsConf 2008: Refactotum: Contributing to Open Source") in May, [Stu](http://thinkrelevance.com/about "Stuart Halloway"), [Justin](http://thinkrelevance.com/about "Justin Gehtland"), [Rob](http://robsanheim.com/ "Rob Sanheim"), and I will be offering up another round of Refactotum open sorcery.

What are people saying about Refactotum?  The 2GX crowd was pretty psyched...  

<blockquote>Showed how you can contribute to open source even if you don't have a lot of time.</blockquote>

Cool.  Time?  What's that?  

<blockquote>Very helpful. I'll definitely follow up by contributing to open source projects.</blockquote>

Right on.

<blockquote>Explaining how to contribute to open source is something that is not usually covered and needs to be taught and evangelized.</blockquote>

And even when the network didn't cooperate...

<blockquote>It turned out to be a giant "pair" programming exercise instead of individual programming and this turned out to be MUCH better. Some of the ideas discussed were really intriguing.</blockquote>

Grab your seat now [before they're all gone](http://blog.rubyonrails.org/2008/3/12/railsconf-seats-filling-up "Riding Rails: RailsConf seats filling up").  Hope to see you there!
