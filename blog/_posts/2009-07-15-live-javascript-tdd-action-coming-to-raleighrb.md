Next week at raleigh.rb, [Larry Karnowski](http://tech.hickorywind.org/ "HickoryTech") and I are pairing up for a round of live test-driven JavaScript development with [Blue Ridge](http://github.com/relevance/blue-ridge "github.com/relevance/blue-ridge - JavaScript BDD Rails Plugin"). Come see how easy and natural it can be to give your JavaScript code the testing love it deserves.

The [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/calendar/10355088/ "The Raleigh-area Ruby Brigade July Meeting - Javascript Testing in Rails: Fast, Headless, In-browser. Pick Any Three. [Larry Karnowski & Jason Rudolph]") is at 7 PM on Tuesday, July 21.  Hope to see you there!
