Andres Almiray [interviewed me this week for the Groovy Zone](http://groovy.dzone.com/news/jason-rudolph-second-leg-grail "Jason Rudolph: Second Leg of the Grails Race — Groovy Zone").  We cover a breadth of topics, including:

* Just how far Grails has come in the past two years
* Why the GORM DSL likely obviates [previous mapping techniques](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2006/06/20/hoisting-grails-to-your-legacy-db/ "jasonrudolph.com - Hoisting Grails to Your Legacy DB")
* Groovy as a gateway drug to more and better developer testing
* Why Grails testing infrastructure improvements deserve top billing in Grails 1.1
* Something called Rails
* New testing-related developments in the Groovy ecosystem

For all that and more, check out the [interview](http://groovy.dzone.com/news/jason-rudolph-second-leg-grail "Jason Rudolph: Second Leg of the Grails Race — Groovy Zone") at [Groovy Zone](http://groovy.dzone.com "Groovy Zone — Everything for the Groovy & Grails developer"), a new(ish) and hoppin' community for Groovy and Grails news.

(Did I mention that we discuss testing?)
