* Mixins, meet Groovy.  [Groovy, say "Hello" to Mixins](http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/groovy/trunk/groovy/groovy-core/src/test/groovy/lang/vm5/MixinTest.groovy?r=13045 "FishEye: file groovy/trunk/groovy/groovy-core/src/test/groovy/lang/vm5/MixinTest.groovy").

* I kindly request that all job postings henceforth forgo the usual mumbo jumbo, replacing it instead with Paul Graham's one metric to rule them all: the [income-to-boringness ratio](http://www.paulgraham.com/prcmc.html "The Pooled-Risk Company Management Company").

* [Snippets and scripts](http://gist.github.com/gists "Gist &mdash; GitHub") deserve [first-class version control](http://github.com/blog/119-intro-to-gist-video "Intro to Gist Video &mdash; GitHub") too.

* If you haven't disabled "new mail" notifications by the time you finish reading this sentence, I'll be forced to hold you personally [responsible for the world's economic misfortunes](http://www.43folders.com/2008/07/21/procrastination-ding "Chronic Procrastination and the Cost of the &quot;Ding!&quot; â€” 43 Folders").  Pull, Folks. Pull.

* Remember the [good ol' days of integrating Grails with a legacy database](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2006/06/20/hoisting-grails-to-your-legacy-db/ "jasonrudolph.com/blog -- Hoisting Grails to Your Legacy DB")?  You know, that long walk ... uphill ... in the snow ... both ways.  [Times sure have changed.](http://grag.sourceforge.net/documentation.html "GRAG - The GRails Application Generator")
