Next Monday (June 18th), I'll be presenting an [introduction to Grails at the Triangle Java Users Group](http://trijug.org/meetinginfo.jsp?date=2007-06).  Scott Davis introduced TriJUG to Groovy back in [April](http://trijug.org/meetinginfo.jsp?date=2007-04), and the response was extraordinary!  Here's your chance to see some more Groovy in action, and really focus on how Groovy (via [Grails](http://grails.org)) breathes new excitement into web development on the Java platform.  (My apologies for the pun.)  

A *local* talk?  I know. I know. It sounds crazy, but the commute should be quite nice.    

The meeting starts at 6:30 PM.  Hope to see you [there](http://trijug.org/meetinginfo.jsp?date=2007-06)!
