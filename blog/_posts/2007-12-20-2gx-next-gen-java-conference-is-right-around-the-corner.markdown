The Groovy community's been busy rolling out a steady stream of holiday goodness for the Java developers of the world:  [Groovy 1.5](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2007/12/07/Groovy+1.5+released "Groovy 1.5 released") was just released, [Grails 1.0 RC3](http://grails.org/1.0-RC3+Release+Notes "Grails - 1.0-RC3 Release Notes") is out, and now the Prags are prepping two new [Groovy](http://pragprog.com/titles/vslg "Programming Groovy: Dynamic Productivity for the Java Developer by Venkat Subramaniam") [books](http://pragprog.com/titles/sdgrvr "Groovy Recipes: Greasing the Wheels of Java by Scott Davis") for early next year.  And to top things off, the folks behind [NFJS](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/ "No Fluff Just Stuff") are hosting a [three-day conference](http://groovygrails.com "Groovy/Grails Experience") with Groovy and Grails experts from all over the world.  

[![2008 2GX Groovy Grails Experience Logo](/resources/2008-2gx-groovy-grails-experience-logo.gif)](http://groovygrails.com "Groovy/Grails Experience")

The inaugural 2G Experience will take place February 21-23 in Reston, VA, and the [agenda](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/schedule?showId=131 "Groovy/Grails Experience - Session Schedule") is slam-packed!  BDD with Andy Glover. DSLs with Venkat Subramaniam. Google Maps with Scott Davis. Metaprogramming with Jeff Brown. A can't-miss JRuby/Groovy smackdown with Neal Ford.  A Grails keynote with Graeme Rocher.  The list goes on...

I'll be presenting sessions on [Going Further with Grails](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/speaker?speakerId=4738&showId=131 "Jason Rudolph - Going Further with Grails") and [Bending GORM: 5-minute Techniques for Enterprise Integration](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/speaker?speakerId=4738&showId=131 "Jason Rudolph - Advanced Domain Models in Grails: Enterprise Integration Made Easy").  And to close out the conference, [Relevance's Refactotum series](http://relevancellc.com/twir "Relevance, Inc. - This Week in Refactoring") will make its Groovy/Grails debut.  I'm teaming up with [Scott Davis](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/speaker?speakerId=18&amp;showId=131) and [Venkat Subramaniam](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/speaker?speakerId=11&amp;showId=131) (and any stray Groovy/Grails devs that happen to wander nearby) to host this hands-on workshop helping attendees make their mark on the Groovy and Grails revolution.

> **[Refactotum: Groovy/Grails](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/speaker?speakerId=4738&amp;showId=131)  (3-hour workshop)**

> Contributing to open source is great for your career.  In a few short hours, you can learn, teach, promote your skills, and improve the quality of the community.  In this unique workshop, we will show you how, by doing it.  Using Grails as an example, we'll show you how to:

> * download the source code
> * build and run tests
> * use Cobertura and code review to find problem areas
> * refactor some code
> * create and submit a patch

> Take this opportunity to begin contributing to Groovy, Grails, or any other open source project that interests you.  Experts from the Groovy and Grails community will be on hand to help you get started.

So is Groovy really "the next generation" of the Java language?  [Come decide for yourself.](http://groovygrails.com/gg/conference/register?showId=131 "2G Experience - Register")  As for me, I couldn't agree more.
