The first edition of *Getting Started with Grails* was [well received](/gswg_reviews.html).
Matt Raible even dubbed it
["the perfect book to learn the basics of Grails quickly."](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/book_reviews_getting_started_with "Raible Designs | Reviews: Getting Started with Grails")
But technology moves fast, and Grails has certainly been no exception.
Much has changed since the days of Grails 0.3â€”the then-current version of Grails in January, 2007.
So when Scott Davis offered to bring *Getting Started with Grails* up to date, who was I to say "No?"

Today, Scott and I are pleased to announce that the [second edition of *Getting Started with Grails*](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/grails-getting-started "InfoQ: Getting Started with Grails, Second Edition") is now available as a [free PDF](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/grails-getting-started "InfoQ: Getting Started with Grails, Second Edition") [1].  Or, for those that prefer the crisp feel of the printed page, the [paperback version](http://www.lulu.com/content/7868425 "lulu.com - Getting Started with Grails, Second Edition") is available as well.

In addition to being the **first book fully compatible with [Grails 1.2](http://www.grails.org/1.2+Release+Notes "Grails - 1.2 Release Notes")**, the second edition expands on the coverage of the first edition.  You'll find entire new sections tackling a variety of key topics from plugins, to codecs, to services, and more.  And thanks to the testability improvements introduced in Grails 1.1, you'll also find an increased emphasis on testing.

Still here?  What are you waiting for?  [Grab the book](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/grails-getting-started "InfoQ: Getting Started with Grails, Second Edition") and get started.  We hope you enjoy it!
