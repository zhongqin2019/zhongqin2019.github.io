After a HUGE week of Groovy and Grails news, the momentum culminates today at the [first International Grails eXchange in London](http://grails-exchange.com).

In case you missed it, the past week has offered announcements including...                                                                                                                

* [SAP launches Grails-based solution for developing applications on their SAP NetWeaver platform](https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/7526)
* [Groovy Project Manager Guillaume Laforge](http://glaforge.free.fr/blog/groovy), [Grails Project Lead Graeme Rocher](http://graemerocher.blogspot.com), and Former JetBrains COO Alex Tkachman announce the formation of [G2One](http://g2one.com), their new company offering Groovy- and Grails-based services
* [Groovy 1.1 RC 1 hits the street](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2007/10/12/Groovy+1.1-rc-1+released "Groovy 1.1 RC1 Release Notes")
* [Grails 1.0 RC 1 makes its debut](http://grails.org/1.0-RC1+Release+Notes "Grails 1.0-RC1 Release Notes")

Graeme and Guillaume kicked off the conference with a Groovy and Grails "State of the Union" keynote highlighting the remarkable momentum behind these two projects, the significant advancements each project has seen this year, as well as a look at the road ahead.  The [next three days](http://www.grails-exchange.com/programme-grails-exchange) promise a wealth of information, and not *just* on Groovy and Grails, but also on Hibernate, Yahoo! UI, Dojo, Spring, Sitemesh, Flex, and other collaborating technologies.  

And other technologies ([even ones that may not *necessarily* be commonly thought of as Groovy/Grails collaborators](http://jruby.org/ "JRuby")) have a [presence](http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2007/10/grails-exchange-qcon-sf-and-openworld.html "Ola Bini at Grails eXchange") here as well.  Rock on!  I'm consistently impressed by the growing cross-pollination and cooperation [between](http://jython.org "Jython") [these](http://jruby.org/ "JRuby") [communities](http://groovy.codehaus.org "Groovy"): the leading dynamic languages on the JVM.  

So tune your feed readers to [Technorati](feed://feeds.technorati.com/search/grails+exchange?authority=a4&amp;language=en) and [Google](feed://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch_feeds?hl=en&amp;q=grails+exchange&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;num=10&amp;output=atom), and keep an eye out for seriously good stuff coming out of the inaugural Grails eXchange.
