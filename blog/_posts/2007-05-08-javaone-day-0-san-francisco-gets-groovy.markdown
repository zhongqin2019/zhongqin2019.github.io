The [No Fluff Just Stuff G2One](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2007/05/01/javaone-preloaded-a-groovygrails-special-event/) event officially kicked off my JavaOne festivities last night, and it turned out to be the veritable *who's who* of Java geekery.  I say that affectionately, of course, and I was quite impressed.  It's a clear testament to the sincere interest the Java community has in the Groovy story.  Faces I saw in the crowd (some of which I had the distinct pleasure to meet) included none other than:  Dick Wall and Carl Quinn (of [Java Posse](http://javaposse.com/) fame), Emmanuel Bernard (of Hibernate and JBoss fame), Romain Guy (of [Filthy Rich Client](http://www.amazon.com/Filthy-Rich-Clients-Developing-Applications/dp/0132413930/) fame and owner of the French accent making occasional, and always hilarious, guest appearances on the afore-mentioned Java Posse), Stu Halloway (most-recently of [Ruby](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/javauniversity.jsp#B4) and [Rails](http://www.relevancellc.com/search?q=rails) fame), David Geary (of [Swing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0130796670/102-1594046-2231364?v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance) and [JSF](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131463055/102-1594046-2231364?v=glance&n=283155&s=books&v=glance) fame), and Chris Richardson (of [POJOs in Action](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1932394583) fame).  And when we capped off the event with the panel discussion, we were presented with a surprise guest host, Ted Neward (of [interoperability/controversy](http://tssblog.techtarget.com/index.php/xmlweb-services/contract-first-or-code-first-design-part-1/) fame (wink)), to preside over the session.  Very cool!  It was a blast!

For those that weren't able to attend the event (or are perhaps still wanting more Groovy/Grails goodness), Jay Zimmerman announced plans for a dedicated Groovy and Grails training program that's set to debut in September and then the first *Groovy Experience* conference scheduled for February of next year.  Stay tuned.  The momentum continues to build.

As a final note, it was great to finally meet so many of the Groovy and Grails pioneers and evangalists in person:  Graeme Rocher (who has a [good write-up on Day 0](http://graemerocher.blogspot.com/2007/05/grails-us-tour-javaone-day-0-g2one.html) as well), Dierk Koenig, Guillaume LaForge, Andrew Glover, and Neal Ford.  Keep groovin', Guys!
