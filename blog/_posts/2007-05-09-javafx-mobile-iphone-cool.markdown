So here's the scene...

* Setting: Moscone Center, Main Hall
* Audience: ~15,000
* Speaker wardrobe: Blue jeans and black shirt   
* Hardware on stage: Macs
* Time: Tuesday morning
* Product being demoed: New handheld tech gadget

Sounds like a [recipe for success](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote), right?   Sadly, no.  All that came to mind is this simple equation:  

   [JavaFX Mobile](http://java.sun.com/javafx/images/javafxscript_large.jpg) = [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) - cool

And for some reason, the phone they had on stage looked 10 times uglier than the one in their [promo pic](http://java.sun.com/javafx/images/javafxscript_large.jpg).  (Where's the marketing department when you need them?)  Of course, the stuttering UI didn't do much for its appeal either.  And is it just me, or did they forget to turn off the spellchecker before they took their [screenshot](http://java.sun.com/javafx/images/javafxscript_large.jpg)?
