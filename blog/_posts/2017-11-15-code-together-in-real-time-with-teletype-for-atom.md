For the last few months, [@nathansobo](https://github.com/nathansobo), [@as-cii](https://github.com/as-cii), and I have been using Teletype to build Teletype. We're excited to share it with the world! P2P collaborative editing for developers, where everyone gets to code with their own config (keyboard shortcuts, themes, fonts, etc.).
