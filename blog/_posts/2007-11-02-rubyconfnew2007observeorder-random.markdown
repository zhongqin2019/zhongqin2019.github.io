* It turns out that hotels prefer that you *not* bring your own bottles of scotch to the bar.  Who knew?

* [Marcel Molina](http://marcelmolina.com/) explains the three pillars of beautiful code as: proportion, integrity, and [clarity](http://robsanheim.com/2007/09/19/less-magic-please/ "Rob - Sanheim asks for 'Less Magic, Please'").

* [Jim Weirich](http://onestepback.org/) gives kudos to [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Builders "Groovy Builder") as the inspiration for [Ruby's Builder library](http://builder.rubyforge.org/).  (Cool!  Cross-pollination goes both ways.  Not a zero-sum game.  Rinse.  Lather.  [Repeat.](http://jicksta.com/articles/2007/08/04/the-methodphitamine "The Methodphitamine - Ruby gets 'it'"))

* If you show up at RubyConf with a Compaq, apparently you spend the morning calculating the distance to the nearest Apple store.

* [David Black](http://dablog.rubypal.com/) reminds the "veeee-gans" that they're special.

* [Nathaniel Talbott](http://terralien.com/ "Terralien"): [Camping](http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html) matters because it gets your mind off the [drug](http://rubyonrails.org) and refocuses you on the [addiction](http://ruby-lang.org).  (OK.  Perhaps I paraphrased.)

* Taking a short break to push a new app live to the world - there's some darn good satisfaction in that!

* [Ryan Davis](http://blog.zenspider.com/archives/2007/11/rubyconf_2007.html "Polishing Ruby: RubyConf 2007"): [Flog](http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html "sudo gem install flog") your code. [Heckle](http://ruby.sadi.st/Heckle.html "sudo gem install heckle") your tests. And while you're at it, flog your feeds, flog your daily habits, and ask your boss and your coworkers to flog *you*. You'll be better because of it.

* Wisdom of [Matz](http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/)...
  * When asked about his *second* favorite programming language: "I love all programming languages, except for several."
  * On working with Apple: Some brief comments on his assistance with Leopard, but offers that "Ruby on the *next* version of OS X will be even better." (Hmmm.  Speculation about a future Apple product.  I suspect that Apple's legal hounds all paused momentarily as they detected a distant disturbance in the force.  Regardless, let's hope he's right.  [Some other languages haven't been so fortunate.](http://javathink.blogspot.com/2007/10/java-6-leopard-apple-sun-whos-really-to.html "Java 6 excluded from Leopard"))
  * When asked what kind of programming he does day-to-day: "Ruby."  Ha!  Go figure.  
  * On whether Ruby is suitable as a first programming language to learn: "Some parents don't give their children sharp knives, but some do."
