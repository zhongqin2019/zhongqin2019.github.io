  <p>Jason is an accomplished presenter, and is currently on the No Fluff Just Stuff tour. If you have a chance to see him present, go see him. He’s entertaining and informative, and will certainly give you quite a lot to absorb about. At least one of his Grails presentations is based on the contents of the book. When I saw him, he walked the group through Grails using the &#8220;racetrack&#8221; tutorial his book is based around. If you’re not fortunate enough to get to see him in person, get this book - it’s the next best thing.</p>
  <p>Because of the tutorial-style nature of <em>Getting Started with Grails</em>, this is the first book I point people to whenever evangelizing Grails. If you’re interested in learning Grails, this is the fastest way to get started!</p>

  <p>A great book, on both Grails and how to write a solid intro programming book. Totally worth the $20.</p>

  <p>I just finished up <em>Getting Started with Grails</em>, the free book from InfoQ by Jason Rudolph. An excellent book. Thanks Jason! I thought it was so good I decided to pay for it (even though it's free) to help support the author and InfoQ.</p>

  <p>For a newbie, I thoroughly recommend <em>Getting Started with Grails</em>. (The PDF is free and the paper copy is pretty cheap, too). I've knocked up a live CRUD app for my main employer using just that book. It walks you through building an application at a sensible pace, without assuming you're some sort of Java guru. ;-) I'd especially recommend it to people coming from a LAMP background.</p>

  <p>Ok, so I've finished the book. And first off, I should say that I think Jason Rudolph is a very good author in communicating Grails to the newbie. He really has a skill in taking you organically into the subject matter, and his writing style is relaxed and "easy on the eyes." Nice one Jason!</p>

  <p>If you are looking for a nice introduction to Grails, this is the one. If you want a book to often revisit Grails concepts easily, this can be the one also.</p>
  <p>I strongly recommend it.</p>

  <p>Jason does an excellent job presenting Grails in a well organized and easy to follow format. I especially like his choice of building the example RaceTrack application. It's so refreshing not having to work though the bookstore example yet again.</p>

  <p>I downloaded your free eBook <em>Getting Started With Grails</em> a little while ago, and I've already worked through the first 60 pages to grok the examples. I can't make myself put it down. You have a marvelously clear and concise writing style that makes me feel right at home learning Grails (and some Groovy to boot!).</p>
  <p>I have been searching for material like this for over a month now, and here it was in your book the whole time. I have learned more about how to use Grails in the past two hours by reading your book, than I have in the past month trying to learn it on my own.</p>
  <p>Thanks for the fabulous kick-start of my Grails machinery!</p>

  <p>I started reading this book around 4pm one afternoon, and I didn't stop until 3am the next morning. I never knew Grails was so cool! I was especially excited because I had just finished a project using Struts 1.3. What a nightmare that was, and what a dream come true Grails is.</p>

  <p>I wholeheartedly have to recommend InfoQ’s <em>Getting Started With Grails</em> mini-book by Jason Rudolph, which is one of the best pieces of IT tutorial / documentation I [have come across] the last months.</p>
